# tt-Accessible

A native, fully accessible TeamTalk client for macOS, built with VoiceOver as a first-class citizen.

The official TeamTalk Qt client on Mac has significant accessibility issues — broken navigation, unresponsive context menus, audio crackling, and sluggish VoiceOver announcements. tt-Accessible is a from-scratch alternative that puts screen reader users first.

## Features

- **Full VoiceOver support** — every window, menu, control, and navigation flow is built for screen readers
- **Full keyboard navigation** — Cmd+1/2/3/4 for UI areas, F5/F6/F7 for identity and channels, and many more
- **Native macOS interface** — real AppKit + SwiftUI, not a cross-platform wrapper
- **Channel browsing and joining** — tree view with users, subchannels, topics
- **Channel and private chat** — with clickable links and VoiceOver announcements
- **File sharing** — upload/download with progress, speed, ETA
- **Push-to-talk** — any key, including a single key or a modifier-only chord; optionally active while another app is in front, plus a "Both" mode that combines muting with push-to-talk
- **Per-user Channel Mixer** — voice volume, media volume, stereo placement, mute and solo for every person in the channel, entirely keyboard- and VoiceOver-driven (Cmd+5)
- **Live audio-device streaming** — broadcast any input device (interface, virtual device, loopback) into the channel alongside your voice (Cmd+Option+A)
- **Multiple profiles** — independent server lists and settings, with several instances side by side
- **BearWare web login** — connect with a bearware.dk account on servers that support it
- **Advanced audio engine** — custom dual-path capture (AVAudioEngine + standalone AUHAL), input gain, channel selection, echo cancellation
- **WebRTC AEC3 echo cancellation** — with real speaker output capture via Core Audio taps (macOS 14.2+), cancels VoiceOver and system sounds
- **Adaptive jitter buffer** — improves audio quality on unstable connections
- **Recording** — muxed (all voices) or per-user, WAV or OGG format, auto-restart on channel change
- **Per-user volume and stereo balance** — persisted across sessions
- **In-window video** — media file streaming with collapsible panel (formats depend on TeamTalk/macOS; 10-bit video is rejected before streaming)
- **Server administration** — user accounts, bans, server properties, save config
- **Per-event announcement customization** — choose exactly which events get announced
- **Three sound packs** — Default, Majorly-G, Old
- **Auto-reconnect** — with last channel rejoin
- **.tt file import/export** — and tt:// link support
- **Automatic updates** — signed and notarized releases delivered in-app via [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org)
- **English, French and Turkish localization** — follows the system language, or force one in Preferences
- **In-app feedback** — report a problem, with diagnostics and logs attached, without a GitHub account

## Requirements

- **macOS 12.0 (Monterey)** or later
- **Universal binary** — works on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
- Echo cancellation with speaker tap requires **macOS 14.2+** (falls back to SDK-only reference on older systems)

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Xcode (with command line tools)
- [p7zip](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/p7zip) — `brew install p7zip`

### Setup

The TeamTalk SDK binary is not included in the repository. Download it before building:

```bash
./scripts/download-sdk.sh
```

This downloads `libTeamTalk5.dylib` and `TeamTalk.h` from the [official TeamTalk SDK](https://www.bearware.dk/?page_id=419) and places them in `Vendor/TeamTalk/`.

### Build

For development:

The Xcode project uses automatic code signing, with the maintainer's team set in `App/Signing.xcconfig`. To sign with your own **Apple Development** certificate, create `App/Signing.local.xcconfig` (git ignores it) containing your team ID:

```
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOURTEAMID
```

Xcode picks it up on its own, so you never have to edit the project file. If you have no certificate at all, disable code signing when building locally:

```bash
# Debug build
xcodebuild -project App/ttaccessible.xcodeproj -scheme ttaccessible -configuration Debug CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build

# Release build
xcodebuild -project App/ttaccessible.xcodeproj -scheme ttaccessible -configuration Release CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

### Packaging (maintainers)

`./build.sh` is for the maintainer team only. It still runs `xcodebuild` with the project's automatic signing settings, so it requires the same **Apple Development** certificate as building in Xcode — it does not produce an unsigned app for other contributors.

```bash
./build.sh              # Release .app and zip in BuildArtifacts/
./build.sh --notarize   # Developer ID signature + Apple notarization
./build.sh --release    # Notarize and publish to GitHub (updates Sparkle appcast)
```

Public releases are signed with a **Developer ID Application** certificate and notarized by Apple. The `--notarize` and `--release` flags apply that maintainer-only signing workflow on top of the Xcode build.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `ttaccessible-*.zip` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/math65/ttaccessible/releases).
2. Unzip and drag `ttaccessible.app` into `/Applications`.
3. Double-click to launch.

The app is signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple, so no Gatekeeper prompt appears on first launch. Subsequent updates are delivered automatically in-app via Sparkle — you can also trigger a check manually from **ttaccessible > Check for updates…**.

## Importing servers

If you already use TeamTalk on your Mac, you can import your saved servers:

1. Open tt-Accessible
2. Go to **Server > Import TeamTalk Servers…**
3. Select your `TeamTalk5.ini` file (the app navigates to the right folder automatically)

## Architecture

Native **macOS AppKit app** with SwiftUI preference panes. Both ends of the audio path are custom, and the TeamTalk SDK is pointed at a virtual sound device so it never owns a physical one.

**Capture** uses a dual-path engine, bypassing the SDK's built-in capture (which causes crackling on macOS): AVAudioEngine for the system default input, and a standalone AUHAL audio unit for any other device — AVAudioEngine cannot reliably bind to a non-default device. Captured PCM is resampled to the channel codec rate and injected via `TT_InsertAudioBlock`.

**Playback** is a custom CoreAudio render engine that mixes each remote user separately, instead of playing the SDK's pre-mixed stream. That is what makes per-user volume, stereo placement, mute and solo possible, and it means switching output device is a fast rebind rather than an SDK teardown.

**Echo cancellation** uses WebRTC AEC3 (from `webrtc-audio-processing` v2.0, WebRTC M131) with the actual speaker output captured via Core Audio taps as the reference signal — not just the decoded TeamTalk audio. This allows cancellation of VoiceOver, system sounds, and all other audio.
