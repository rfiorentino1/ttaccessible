//
//  An accessible push-to-talk key field. Captures the next key press into a
//  HotkeyBinding — a single key, a key+modifier combo, or a pure-modifier chord
//  (e.g. ⌘⌃ pressed and released on its own). Presents as a plain button, so
//  VoiceOver announces "button" rather than the "search field" the old
//  KeyboardShortcuts recorder produced.
