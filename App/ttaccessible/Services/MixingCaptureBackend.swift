//  MixingCaptureBackend.swift
//  ttaccessible
//
//  Several capture sources streamed as one — any mix of input devices, plus the chosen
//  applications or all audio from this Mac. Each part keeps its own capture backend,
//  filling a ring of its own; a 10 ms beat on the wall clock mixes them into the stream's
//  ring, which the loopback server paces and serves exactly as it does a single source.
//
//  Every device runs on its own clock, and none of them is the wall clock the server
//  paces by, so over minutes each source would drift ahead or behind. StreamMixer keeps a
//  small cushion per source and nudges that source's playback rate — by a few hundred
//  parts per million at most, far below anything audible — to hold the cushion steady.
//  Nothing is dropped or padded to follow the drift, so there is nothing to click. Only a
//  genuine stall (an unplugged device, a silent app backend) falls back to silence, and a
//  source that comes back is picked up again.
//
