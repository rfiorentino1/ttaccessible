When you're connected, the window is titled Connected Server followed by the name of the server. It
is split into two panes. A sidebar holds the server name, its status lines, the microphone button
and the channel tree; the pane beside it holds the mixer, the chat, the message box and the session
history. Everything you need is there, so you never have to leave it.

The divider between the two panes can be dragged, and tt-Accessible remembers where you left it.

## Move between the areas

Press one of these shortcuts to put the keyboard focus — and the VoiceOver cursor — where you need
it:

| Shortcut | Area |
|---|---|
| Command-1 | Main area: the tree of channels and users |
| Command-2 | Chat history |
| Command-3 | Message input |
| Command-4 | Session history |
| Command-5 | Channel Mixer |

These shortcuts also work while the Private Messages window is in front, where Command-1,
Command-2 and Command-3 take you to its conversation list, its history and its input field. When no
session is open, Command-1 brings back the TeamTalk Servers window.

## Read the channel tree

The tree lists the channels of the server and, under each one, the people in it. Use the arrow keys
to browse it and press Return to join the selected channel. To see the actions available for a row,
Control-click it, or use the VoiceOver actions rotor.

Each row is announced with everything that matters about it:

- A channel adds *current channel*, *password protected* or *hidden* when they apply, and reads its
  topic when it has one.
- A person adds *you*, *administrator*, *channel operator*, *talking*, *away* or *question*.

To change the order of the channels, open Preferences, click Connection, then use the **Sort
channels by** pop-up menu.

## Follow what happens in the session

The session history collects the events of the session: connections, people arriving and leaving,
channel changes, kicks, subscription changes, files added or removed, automatic away and media
streaming. To choose which of them are spoken, see
[Choose sounds and announcements](sounds-announcements.html).

To save the conversation, press Shift-Command-S.

## Use the audio controls

The microphone button sits in the sidebar, under the channel tree.

The volumes themselves — **Output volume**, **Input volume**, **Sound effects volume** and **Media
volume** — are sliders in the window, just above the channel mixer, so you can land on each one
directly. See [Balance a channel with the mixer](mixer.html) for the mixer itself.

To hear the current audio status at any time — whether output is active, whether the microphone is
transmitting, and whether a recording is running — press F9.

## Change your nickname or status

- To change your nickname, press F5. Leave the field empty to go back to your default nickname.
- To change your status, press F6, then choose **Available**, **Away** or **Question**, a gender,
  and a status message if you want one.

tt-Accessible can also set your status to Away on its own when you stop using the keyboard. See
[Change tt-Accessible settings](preferences.html#prefs-general).

## Watch a video

When someone streams a video file into the channel, a Video panel appears, which you can show or
hide. It reports *No video* when nothing is playing.

## If the connection drops

The window shows **Reconnecting**, and tt-Accessible tries to bring the session back — including
rejoining the channel you were in. To turn these behaviours on or off, open Preferences and click
Connection.

To leave the server, press F2. If you opened the server from a `.tt` file or a link without saving
it, tt-Accessible offers to save it first.
